    and use their stances to uncover a deeper understanding of the subject at hand.

        or family to a wider audience. With writing drafts and coming up with arguments, I’ve also seen myself grow as a writer, allowing me to support my 
        arguments more effectively. As teenagers, it’s easy to feel like our voices do not matter as much as adults, 
        but this department has allowed for many students’ voices to be recognized, and I find that very special.`,
